# A Quiz App
###### source: Exponential Ventures

Nowadays, it has become popular amongst internet users to spend some of their time
testing their general knowledge through quizzes (and brag about it when they ace it). The idea
is to design the prototype for a quiz app that is pleasant, engaging, and easy to use. In the end,
we’ll inform the user about his performance and translate those results into a grade.

## Requirements

1. Each question has only four possible answers, of which only one is correct.
2. On top of showing the grade, show statistics on how the user’s answers compared to the
other users that answered these questions before
3. On the results page, show a range of different expertise levels for each grade bracket
with a short description for each expertise level. E.g.
- Score 0-2: Clueless. Don’t be discouraged! Learn some more about this topic,
and come back to try again!
- Score 3-5: Beginner. This is the level most players end up with after answering
this quiz for the first time. Learn some more about this topic and come back to try
again!
- core 5-8: Confident: This is the level players are getting pro! Continue your
progress and rock it!
- Score 8-10: Expert: This is the highest level achievable! Thanks for being
awesome as you are!
4. Show the time it took to answer the quiz.
5. We encourage you to work with your creativity, implementing features and quizzes that
you would like to see and answer
6. Create an authentication method, and only allow users who were already registered in
the database, so you will not need to create a signup page.

#### Bonus Features

1. Allow the user to share the result of his quiz on social media.
2. Allow multiple quizzes to be administered through the same app.
3. Record the user’s performance from previous attempts and compare performance
improvement over time.
4. Sign up page for new users.
5. Testing coverage - Testing is highly encouraged as a bonus feature
